# Processing programming projects (Java)


Processing is an open-source graphical library and integrated development environment (IDE) built for artists, designers, and programmers to create interactive graphics and visualizations. It is particularly popular for creating visual art, animations, games, and simulations. While Processing has its own syntax and functions to make graphical tasks and interactive applications easier, the underlying programming model is powered by Java.

I made the following projects with processing:

- Bubble_Catcher_Game
	- This code creates a simple game where bubbles appear randomly on the screen, and the player can control a catcher 		platform to catch the bubbles. The goal is to catch 10 bubbles without missing  10. Otherwise, the game ends with a "Won" 	or "Lost" message based on the result.

- Flappy_Bird_Game
	- This code implements a simplified version of the well-known "Flappy Bird" game, where a bird has to fly through openings 	in pillars to score points.

- Interactive_Cat_Drawing
	- This code creates an interactive drawing of a cat where the eyes follow the mouse movement. Clicking on the nose or 		pressing 	the spacebar triggers changes in the drawing.

- Interactive_Grape_Color_Changer
	- This code allows you to interactively change the color of the grapes by pressing the spacebar or by placing the mouse on 	different sides of the drawing area.

- Interactive_Space_Scene
	- This code displays a visual simulation of a space scene with moving stars and a UFO.
